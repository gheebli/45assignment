1. Delete VOTE pod observe UI and Unix
The UI was not updated until I did a refresh.  At that time I saw the new VOTE pod name.
The RC created a new VOTE pod.

2. Delete WORKER pod observe UI and Unix
The UI was not affected.  No change even after refresh as the VOTE pod was unaffected.
The RC restart the WORKER pod.

3. Delete DB pod observe UI and Unix
The UI was not affected.  No change even after refresh as the VOTE pod was unaffected.

The RC restart the DB pod.

4. What did you do to get the "RESULT" pod to work
Noithing the RESULT pod was unaffected.
